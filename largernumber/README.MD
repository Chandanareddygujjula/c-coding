# Find the Largest of Three Numbers in C
This is a simple C program that reads three integer numbers from the user and finds the largest number among them.  
The Program prompts the user to input three numbers a,b,c.  
Here I'm initialising that the first number (a) as the largest.  
By using if condition it compares that,  
i. if b is greater than the current largest, then the largest is updated to b.  
ii. if c is greater than the updated largest, then the largest is updated to c.  
Atlast, the program prints the value of largest.  
  
# Expected Output :
Enter first number: 5  
Enter second number: 3  
Enter third numbers: 8  
The Largest value is : 8
