# Simple Calculator  
This is a basic simple calculator written in the C programming language.  
The program allows users to perform arithematic operations.  
i.Addition  ii.Subtraction  iii.Multiplication  iv.Division  v.Choose to exit  
The program greets the user with a welcome message.  
int option -> Here we are declaring a variable named as option to integer data type (option contains like numbers 1,2,3,4,5.).  
The program displays a memu with 5 options.  
scanf() -> here it implies that the information taken by the user in the output.  
  
Here we are using the "if else" condition.  
# if else :  
It is a conditional statement.  
i. if condition 1 is true, it executes the block of code. And reamining conditions will skip.  
ii. if condition 1 is false, it checks the else if condition, if it is true then it executes.  
  
The user selects an option by entering a number 1-5.  
if 5 is selected then the program displays a thankyou message and ends the program.  
Here we are taking two user inputs (a&b), cause to perform the choosen calculations.  
if an operation is selected (1-4) then :  
if the user choose 1 -> it displays Addition (a+b).  
if the user choose 2 -> it displays Subtraction (a-b).  
if the user choose 3 -> it displays Multiplication (a*b).  
if the user choose 4 -> it displays Division (a/b).
