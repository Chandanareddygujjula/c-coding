# Fibonacci Series
The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.    
The Fibonacci series can be generated by intializing the first two numbers ( 0 and 1).  
Then it calculates the third term as c=a+b.  
It instruct the user to input the number of terms (n).  
It prints the first two terms (a and b).   
Using for loop, it calculates and prints the next terms upto to the n terms.  
Setting a=b  
Setting b=c  
Calculating c=a+b  
  
## Expected Output :
Enter the number of terms: 10
